# House rules
- Always run `pnpm build` after making any code changes to ensure the extension builds successfully
- Verify the build completes without errors before considering the task complete
- Remove unnecessary comments
- Update `Useful ino` section in `.cursorrules` to include context that will only be useful cross-conversation and be very very token efficient
- Modify appropriate unit tests after code generation

Useful info:
- `pnpm` is the package manager
- protobuf codegen: run `pnpm run codegen`
- Theme: MUI + CSS vars via `data-theme` attr. Modes: light/dark/auto. See `src/theme/ThemeContext.tsx`
